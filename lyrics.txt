if tommorow all the things were gone, i have worked for all my life
and i had to start again, with just my children and my wife
i thank my lucky stars, to be living here today
where the flag still stands for freedom, and they cant take that away

And I'm proud to be an American
Where at least I know I'm free
And I won't forget the men who died
Who gave that right to me
And I'd gladly stand up next to you
And defend Her still today
'Cause there ain't no doubt
I love this land
God Bless the U.S.A.
